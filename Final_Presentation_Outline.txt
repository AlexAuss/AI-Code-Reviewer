Overview
The synchronized presentation is a concise oral summary of the Final Project Report. The pre-
sentation should clearly communicate the problem, methodology, and final results within a 10–12
minute time window.
Presentation Guideline
Slide 1: Title & Team (30 seconds)
The opening slide should include:
• Project title
• Team member names
• A single concise sentence describing the problem or task
Slides 2–3: Introduction & Problem Definition (1.5–2 minutes)
This section motivates the project and sets the context. Cover the following:
• The research question or task being addressed
• Motivation and real-world relevance of the problem
• Connections to course topics, such as:
– Prompt engineering
– Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
– Fine-tuning
– Evaluation methodologies
Guideline: Keep this section high-level and conceptual. Avoid implementation details.

Slide 4: Dataset (1–1.5 minutes)
Describe the dataset actually used in the final implementation:
• Dataset source(s)
• Dataset size and structure
• Key preprocessing or filtering steps
• Ethical considerations, including bias, privacy, and licensing (if applicable)
Slides 5–6: Methods / System Design (3–4 minutes)
This is one of the most important sections of the presentation. Include:
• An overall system or architecture diagram
• Description of major system components:
– Prompting strategy
– Retrieval pipeline (if applicable)
– Fine-tuning or agent-based design (if applicable)
– Evaluation workflow
• Models used and the rationale for choosing them
• Engineering constraints and design considerations:
– API or rate limits
– Computational resources
– Latency or cost constraints
Slides 7–8: Final Results (3–4 minutes)
This is the most important part of the presentation.
Include only final, complete results:
• Quantitative results, such as:
– Accuracy, F1 score
– BLEU / ROUGE
– Win-rate
2
– Latency or cost
– Human evaluation scores
• Qualitative analysis:
– Example outputs
– Side-by-side comparisons
– Representative error or failure cases
• Comparative analysis:
– Baselines
– Alternative prompts
– With vs. without RAG
– Fine-tuned vs. non–fine-tuned models
• Interpretation of observed behaviors and performance trends
Slide 9: Reflection, Limitations & Future Work (1–1.5 minutes)
This concluding section should be concise.
• Reflection:
– Key lessons learned
– Major changes since the midterm
• Limitations:
– Dataset limitations
– Model weaknesses
– Evaluation constraints
• Future work:
– Realistic and technically grounded extensions or improvements
